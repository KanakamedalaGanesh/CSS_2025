Positions in CSS : CSS positions are used to position elements in a document. There are 5 types of positions in CSS, including:
1.Absolute Positioning: This type of positioning removes the element from the normal document flow and positions it relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. 
  The element is positioned at the coordinates specified by the top, right, bottom , and left properties.
2.Relative Positioning: This type of positioning positions an element relative to its normal position. 
  The element is positioned at the coordinates specified by the top, right, bottom, and left properties.
3.Static Positioning: This is the default positioning scheme. The element is positioned according to the normal document flow.
4.Fixed Positioning: This type of positioning removes the element from the normal document flow and positions it relative to the viewport.
5.Sticky Positioning: This type of positioning is a combination of relative and fixed positioning. The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, but it also stays within the viewport when scrolled.
